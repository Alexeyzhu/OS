First time in my input were only ones. It gave my 999/1 hit/miss result for all 3 frames. There was only one miss because initially table in empty.
Then, in my input were all different numbers. It gave my 0/1000 hit/miss result for all 3 frames. All different input generates all misses.
So, we can conclude that if we want to increase hit rate we should add more equal numbers and put them as close as possible.
