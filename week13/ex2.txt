Recovery:
If resource is preemptable, we can take it from one process to another (but it's often difficult to find so).
Also, we can log checkpoints of processes and roll back if resource is needed to another process, but only
if operation made by first process were idempotent. The same situation also with the killing the process.
So, this approach gives us an opportunity to deal with deadlocks when they occur. If there often
only a few number of deadlocks occur saves our time a bit ( instead of computing a lot, we save a lot )

Prevention:
It's can be implemented in most cases with less expenses.

Avoidance:
In practice banker algorithm is useless because we cannot say exactly about amount
of requirement resources, but if we know in advance how much resources are needed algo is
quite good and simple solution that others.
